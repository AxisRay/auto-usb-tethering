# Auto USB Tethering
(Re)start USB tethering automatically when a cable is plugged in (requires root)

Developed for a private project with the following requirements:
- Does not rely on any Google Services
- Starts automatically at phone boot 
- Observes USB connection continuously, probably via service + broadcast receiver
- Currently targets Android 7.1 custom ROM on a Nexus 5

Contributions for extending support to other devices and OS versions are welcome!
